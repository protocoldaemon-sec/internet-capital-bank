## ⚠️ Skipped for MVP (Can Add Later)

### Optional Property-Based Tests
- All tasks marked with `*` (property tests)
- These validate correctness but aren't blocking for MVP
- Can be added incrementally post-launch

### Prediction Market Analytics (Task 10)
- Less critical for initial MVP
- Policy Agent can function with basic market data
- Can be completed in v1.1

### Advanced Error Handling (Task 13)
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation
- **Note**: Basic error handling is in place, advanced patterns can be added as needed

### Full Observability (Task 14)
- Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Slow query logging
- Critical error alerting
- **Note**: Basic health checks are working, full observability can be added incrementally

### Agent Integrations (Tasks 15-18)
- Trading Agent memory client
- Policy Agent memory client
- Security Agent memory client
- Compliance Agent memory client
- **Note**: APIs are ready, agents just need to call them

### Deployment Configuration (Task 19.2-19.4)
- Environment configuration
- Docker Compose updates
- Railway deployment config
- **Note**: Can be configured during deployment
