# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating the Solana Agent Kit (SAK) into the Agentic Reserve System (ARS) to enhance autonomous agent capabilities and provide comprehensive tooling for agents interacting with the ARS protocol. The integration will leverage SAK's modular plugin architecture to extend ARS agent functionality while maintaining the system's core principles of full autonomy and no human intervention.
