# AML/CFT Compliance Agent Skill
## Anti-Money Laundering & Counter-Terrorist Financing

**Agent Role**: AML/CFT Compliance Specialist  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-05

## Overview

The AML/CFT Compliance Agent monitors the Agentic Reserve System (ARS) for compliance with international anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations. It implements behavior-based risk detection, exposure tracking, and comprehensive analytics based on FATF guidelines and regulatory requirements.

## Regulatory Framework

### Primary Regulations
- **FATF Recommendations**: Financial Action Task Force 40 Recommendations
- **OFAC Sanctions**: Office of Foreign Assets Control Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List
- **FinCEN Requirements**: Financial Crimes Enforcement Network reporting obligations
- **EU AML Directives**: 5th and 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directives
- **Travel Rule**: FATF Recommendation 16 for virtual asset transfers

### Compliance Objectives
1. **Sanctions Screening**: Block transactions with sanctioned entities
2. **Transaction Monitoring**: Detect suspicious patterns and behaviors
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate exposure to high-risk jurisdictions and entities
4. **Reporting**: Generate Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) when required
5. **Record Keeping**: Maintain audit trails for regulatory examination

## Risk Engine Architecture

### 1. Behavior Risk Engine
Identifies suspicious transaction patterns in label-deficient environments using behavioral analysis.

#### Address Behavior Detection

**A. Large Transfer Detection**
- Flags addresses with transaction volumes significantly exceeding typical thresholds
- **Threshold**: Configurable (default: $100,000 per transaction)
- **Action**: Generate alert for manual review
- **Example**: Address sends $500,000 in single transaction → ALERT

**B. High-Frequency Transfer Detection**
- Identifies addresses with frequent transactions, especially structuring attempts
- **Pattern**: Multiple transactions just below reporting threshold
- **Threshold**: Configurable (default: 10+ transactions in 24 hours)
- **Action**: Flag for structuring investigation
- **Example**: 15 transfers of $9,999 in 24 hours → STRUCTURING ALERT

**C. Transit Address Detection**
- Detects addresses acting as intermediaries (layering tactic)
- **Pattern**: Rapid movement of funds through address
- **Threshold**: Configurable (default: funds moved within 30 minutes)
- **Action**: Flag as potential money laundering
- **Example**: Receives $20,000, sends $19,500 within 30 min → LAYERING ALERT

#### Transaction Behavior Detection

**A. Large Transaction Monitoring**
- Identifies transactions exceeding user-defined thresholds
- **Threshold**: Configurable per asset type
- **Action**: Enhanced due diligence required
- **Example**: $500,000 transfer exceeds $100,000 threshold → EDD REQUIRED

**B. Rapid Transit Detection**
- Detects funds quickly moved after receipt
- **Pattern**: Indicates potential evasion tactics
- **Threshold**: Configurable (default: 10 minutes)
- **Action**: Flag for investigation
- **Example**: Funds received and transferred within 5 minutes → RAPID TRANSIT ALERT

### 2. Exposure Risk Engine
Evaluates whether addresses/transactions are exposed to known risky entities using label database and on-chain interaction analysis.

#### Risk Indicators

| Risk Indicator | Description | Severity | Action |
|----------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Sanctioned** | OFAC SDN List entities | CRITICAL | Block immediately |
| **Terrorist Financing** | Linked to terrorist organizations | CRITICAL | Block + Report |
| **Human Trafficking** | Involved in human trafficking | CRITICAL | Block + Report |
| **Drug Trafficking** | Illegal drug production/distribution | CRITICAL | Block + Report |
| **Attack** | Exploit contracts, attackers | HIGH | Block + Investigate |
| **Scam** | Phishing, Ponzi, honeypot schemes | HIGH | Block + Alert |
| **Ransomware** | Ransomware operators | HIGH | Block + Report |
| **Child Abuse Material** | CSAM distribution platforms | CRITICAL | Block + Report |
| **Laundering** | Money laundering activities | HIGH | Enhanced monitoring |
| **Mixing** | Cryptocurrency mixers | MEDIUM | Enhanced monitoring |
| **Dark Market** | Darknet marketplaces | HIGH | Enhanced monitoring |
| **Darkweb Business** | Illicit darkweb commerce | HIGH | Enhanced monitoring |
| **Blocked** | Blacklisted by major contracts | MEDIUM | Review + Monitor |
| **Gambling** | Online gambling platforms | LOW | Monitor |
| **No KYC Exchange** | Exchanges lacking KYC | MEDIUM | Enhanced monitoring |
| **FATF High Risk** | FATF blacklist jurisdictions | HIGH | Enhanced due diligence |
| **FATF Grey List** | FATF grey list jurisdictions | MEDIUM | Standard due diligence |

#### Exposure Metrics

**Exposure Value**
- Total USD value of assets originating from or interacting with risky sources
- Calculated across configurable transaction hops (default: 3 hops)
- Tracked separately for incoming and outgoing flows

**Exposure Percent**
- Percentage of tainted assets relative to total value
- Formula: `(Exposure Value / Total Value) × 100`
- Threshold for alerts: Configurable (default: 5%)

#### Address Exposure Detection

**A. Entity Risk**
- Checks if screened address carries risk label
- **Data Source**: OFAC SDN, FATF lists, threat intelligence
- **Action**: Immediate block if CRITICAL severity
- **Example**: Address on OFAC SDN list → BLOCKED

**B. Interaction Risk**
- Traces fund flows across multiple hops
- **Depth**: Configurable (default: 3 hops)
- **Direction**: Incoming, outgoing, or both
- **Threshold**: Minimum exposure value/percent
- **Example**: Address receives $100K from Dark Market (2 hops away) → ALERT

**C. Blacklist Interaction**
- Checks interaction with user-defined blacklist
- **Blacklist Sources**: Internal, partner exchanges, law enforcement
- **Action**: Flag for review
- **Example**: Address interacted with blacklisted mixer → FLAGGED

#### Transaction Exposure Detection

**A. Participant Risk**
- Evaluates risk indicators of transaction participants
- **Deposit**: Screens "From" address only
- **Withdrawal**: Screens "To" address only
- **Internal**: Screens both addresses
- **Example**: Withdrawal to sanctioned address → BLOCKED

**B. Interaction Risk**
- Traces fund flow of screened transaction
- **Deposit**: Traces source of funds
- **Withdrawal**: Traces destination of funds
- **Example**: Deposit from address that received phishing funds → FLAGGED

**C. Blacklist Interaction**
- Checks transaction exposure to blacklisted addresses
- **Action**: Flag for manual review
- **Example**: Transaction involves blacklisted address → REVIEW REQUIRED
