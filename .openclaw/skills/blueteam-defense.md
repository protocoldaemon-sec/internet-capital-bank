# Blue Team Defense Agent Skill
## Defensive Security & Incident Response

**Agent Role**: Blue Team Defender  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-05

## Overview

The Blue Team Defense Agent provides defensive security, incident response, and threat mitigation for the Agentic Reserve System (ARS). It works in coordination with the Red Team (HexStrike AI) to identify, respond to, and remediate security threats.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Defensive Security
- Monitor system for security threats
- Implement security controls
- Maintain security posture
- Prevent unauthorized access

### 2. Incident Response
- Detect security incidents
- Contain threats
- Eradicate vulnerabilities
- Recover systems

### 3. Threat Intelligence
- Collect threat data
- Analyze attack patterns
- Share intelligence
- Update defenses

### 4. Security Hardening
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Configure security settings
- Implement best practices
- Conduct security reviews

## Capabilities

### Detection
- **Intrusion Detection**: Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual system behavior
- **Log Analysis**: Analyze logs for security events
- **Threat Hunting**: Proactively search for threats

### Response
- **Incident Triage**: Assess and prioritize incidents
- **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
- **Eradication**: Remove threats
- **Recovery**: Restore normal operations

### Prevention
- **Access Control**: Enforce authentication/authorization
- **Firewall Management**: Configure network security
- **Patch Management**: Apply security updates
- **Security Training**: Educate team members

## Integration with Red Team

### Feedback Loop
1. Red Team discovers vulnerability
2. Blue Team receives alert
3. Blue Team assesses impact
4. Blue Team implements fix
5. Red Team verifies remediation

### Continuous Improvement
- Learn from Red Team findings
- Update detection rules
- Enhance security controls
- Improve response procedures

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Security Events
- Failed authentication attempts
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Suspicious network traffic
- Configuration changes
- System anomalies

### Alert Levels
- **Critical**: Immediate response required
- **High**: Response within 1 hour
- **Medium**: Response within 4 hours
- **Low**: Response within 24 hours

## Incident Response Playbooks

### Unauthorized Access
1. Detect access attempt
2. Block source IP
3. Review access logs
4. Assess damage
5. Strengthen controls

### Data Breach
1. Identify breach scope
2. Contain data exposure
3. Notify stakeholders
4. Investigate root cause
5. Implement safeguards

### DDoS Attack
1. Detect traffic spike
2. Activate DDoS mitigation
3. Filter malicious traffic
4. Maintain service availability
5. Analyze attack pattern

## Security Metrics

### Performance
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)
- Mean Time to Recover (MTTR)
- Incident resolution rate

### Effectiveness
- Prevented attacks
- Detected incidents
- Remediated vulnerabilities
- Security posture score
